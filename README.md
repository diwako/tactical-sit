# Tactical Sit

_Tactical Sit_ is the next evolution in battlefield readiness: emotional resilience through seating.

You know the mission. You trained for weeks. Your gear is dialed in. Your rifle is spotless. Your squad is stacked.

And now…\
…you wait.

Command said, “Stand by for further orders.” That was 27 minutes ago. Your squad leader is whisper-yelling into the radio. Platoon is arguing about grid coordinates. Someone is definitely on the wrong frequency. Nobody is moving. Nobody is shooting.

You are just standing there.\
Like a fool.

Enter **Tactical Sit**, the premier folding chair deployment system for the modern operator who understands that the true enemy is lower back pain and awkward idle animations.

With Tactical Sit, you can fold a chair, stash it in your inventory, and redeploy it anywhere duty calls… or refuses to call back.

**Hill overwatch?** Sit.\
**Waiting for the green light?** Sit.\
**Watching a road that has not seen traffic since 2009?** Sit.\
**Ordered to "observe and report" until the heat death of the universe?** Sit like the professional you are.

## Field Scenarios

Picture it:

- Your squad is frozen on a ridgeline while command debates strategy. You calmly deploy your chair like a battlefield sommelier.
- The convoy is delayed. Again. You establish seating superiority.
- Your spotter whispers, “Movement… false alarm.” Good thing you are already seated.
- Leadership orders, “Hold this hill.” You respond, “Copy.” Chair deployed. Mission accomplished.

Your teammates stand. They fidget. They question their life choices.

You sit.

Because you planned ahead.

## Doctrine-Compliant Comfort

Fully optimized for **German milsim gameplay**, Tactical Sit honors the proud tradition of disciplined waiting, procedural patience, and aggressively organized observation. Efficiency, order, and tactical comfort, exactly as doctrine intended.

This is not just a mod.

It is a statement.

> “If I am going to wait 40 minutes for orders… I am doing it comfortably.”

**Tactical Sit**\
When the mission says stand by, but your spine says absolutely not.
